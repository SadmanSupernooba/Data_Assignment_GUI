There are some data in “raw_data” sheet. Each row represents contemporaneous data of a solution (i.e. both valid and invalid solutions) for a given case. There are three different cases. Each case has number of solutions. The solution ID numbers are presented in Column A (2_0…..2_69 are solutions for case 2, 3_0…..3_44 are solutions for case 3 and 4_0……4_246 are solutions for case 4). If the value in column L is positive then the solution is valid otherwise invalid. There can be multiple solutions for each case. A solution will be the best solution for a case if the following two conditions are fulfilled:
1. The solution is a valid solution
2. The solution is the cheapest solution. The cost for each solution is presented in column Q .
 
Your tasks are as follows:
1. Develop a GUI
2. Present all the data in tabular format in GUI
3. Sort the data to have all the valid solutions for each case and present in tabular format in GUI
4.Sort out the best solutions for each case and present in tabular format in GUI
 
Please make your assumption and mention it in the answer pack (coding/docs/presentation). As a suggestion, you can consider few random numbers as positive values and the rest as negative values for each case/scenario.
